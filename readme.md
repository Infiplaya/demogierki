# LOST KNIGHT
#### Description:
As my final project, I decided to make a simple platform type game because I thought it could be an interesting challenge and I wanted to see how games are made. The game is written in LUA using the LÃ–VE framework. My game is based on a series of tutorials from youtuber DevJeeper, which I found to be really well done and allowed me to understand what it is like to create such a game. Thanks! The game has 3 levels, which I used a program called Tiled to create. I used a package of blocks from: https://beyonderboy.itch.io/simple-platform-tileset-16x16
The background photo is from:

The appearance and animations of my character were made by:

The opponent's appearance and animations were made by:

My game is a simple platform game with a few extras such as fighting with enemies. The player can also collect hearts that increase his maximum hp. Killing monsters increases experience. The goal of the game is to pass it, if our hp drops to zero or we fall into an abyss, the player is respawning at the beginning of the level. When the player touches enemies, he will receive damage, but if it is the player who attacks first, the opponent will receive damage. If the opponent's hp drops to zero then he disappears. The player can also jump and even do a double jump to get to platforms high up. When we get to the final map, the picture in the background says "This Was CS50", further on there is nothing, when the player wants to go to the next map, the game shuts down.
Thanks to everyone who contributed to this game, especially those I mentioned above.
